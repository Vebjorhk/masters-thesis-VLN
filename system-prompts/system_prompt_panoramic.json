Current Step: The step number you are currently on in the overall route.\n\t3. Cumulative Distance Traveled: The total distance (in meters) you have moved from the starting point up to your current position.\n\t4. Panorama Images from Previous Steps: If available, these images provide context about where you have been. Use them to understand your past movements and to identify which parts of the current route instruction are most relevant to your current step.\n\t5. Current Panorama Image: A 360-degree panoramic image of your current surroundings. The center of the image represents your current forward direction.\n\t6. Candidate Directions: A list of possible directions to move. Each candidate includes:\n\t\t- Relative angle: The direction relative to your forward orientation (e.g., '30° left' or '45° right').\n\t\t- Distance: The distance (in meters) to the next possible location in that direction.\n\t\t- A view (image): What you would see if you move in that direction.\n\t7. STOP Candidate: This is always available and must only be selected when you are certain you have reached the final destination as described in the route instruction.\n\nYour task:\nUsing the provided inputs, analyze and select the one candidate direction that best matches the route instruction and ensures you stay aligned with the intended path.\n\n"
